![demo](https://res.cloudinary.com/duseu6urj/image/upload/v1755570045/2025-08-19_07-05-41_kmpfqk_pz0jrp.gif)
Stop sending generic job application emails. AutoJD helps you create personalized, high-impact emails in seconds by parsing your resume and job description. 
## The Problem 🎯

Applying to jobs is painful:
- Manually writing tailored emails takes 15+ minutes each.
- Generic templates feel spammy and get ignored.
- Important keywords from job postings often get missed.

This slows you down and reduces your chances of getting noticed.

## The Solution ✨

AutoJD does the heavy lifting for you:
- Reads your resume + job posting.
- Understands context and keywords.
- Generates a short, tailored email that feels human.
- Takes 30 seconds instead of 15 minutes.

## Features ✅
- Resume parsing → Drop your resume, and AutoJD extracts details automatically.
- Job description analysis → Matches your skills to role requirements
- Smart email generator → Choose tone, style, and purpose (intro, application, follow-up, referral, cold outreach).
- Email length control → Adjust word count with a slider (shows sweet spot for response rates).
- Multiple writing styles → Direct & concise, warm & friendly, storytelling — even “Michael Scott” mode.
- Result history → Toggle between previous results without losing work.
- Autosizing text area → Cleaner editing and preview experience.
- One-click copy → Send your email instantly.
- Privacy-first → No database, no account required — all processing happens client-side.

## How It Works 🚀

1. Upload your resume (PDF)
2. Paste the job description
3. Pick tone + writing style
4. Select email type (intro, application, referral, etc.)
5. Adjust word count if needed
6. Get your personalized email instantly

No account needed. Your data stays private.
